/**
 * Consider a tobacco shop with three smokers and a tobacconist.
 * 
 * Each smoker smokes in an infinite loop.
 * 
 * Each smoker must wait for certain conditions (having supplies to smoke)
 * before smoking.
 * 
 * The tobacconist produces supplies for smokers to smoke forever.
 * 
 * To ensure true concurrency, it is important to note that the solution must
 * allow several smokers to smoke simultaneously.
 * 
 * The requirements for smokers and tobacconist are the following:
 * 
 * Before smoking it is necessary to roll a cigarette, for this the smoker needs
 * three ingredients:
 * tobacco, paper and matches.
 * Each smoker has only tobacco, paper or matches.
 * The tobacconist randomly places two different ingredients out of the three
 * needed to make a cigarette. The smoker who has the third ingredient should
 * remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply)
 * to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while.
 * Once the smoker has made his cigarette, the tobacconist places two new random
 * items.
 * The solution must avoid deadlocks between the different threads. It also must
 * produce messages on the standard output to track the activity of the threads:
 * 
 * The tobacconist must indicate when he produces ingredients and which supplies
 * he produces.
 * Each smoker must indicate when he waits, which product(s) he waits for, and
 * when he starts and stops smoking.
